Questions:

1. I don't think we have gotten to this yet but what does "->" do? Is it the same as l.size() in Java?

2. I also still don't understand why we only need two files here and why you can define the functions in the header.

3. Why don't you need the usual #ifndef, etc. stuff in the header file?
