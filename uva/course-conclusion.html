## Course Objectives

<div style="font-size:80%">
<ul>
<li>Understand program representation from the high-level programming language perspective down to the underlying machine level representation, including: number representation, operations, conditionals, and control structures</li>
<li>Be able to implement basic and advanced abstract data types in C++ including: linked lists, stacks, queues, hash tables, trees, and graphs</li>
<li>Be able to evaluate asymptotic time and space complexity analysis of programs and data structure implementations using Big-O, Big-Omega, and Big-Theta notation and assess the suitability of a data structure for a particular problem</li>
<li>Understand the basic program execution model and the underlying computer hardware and software (fetch-execute cycle, memory hierarchy, operating system, compiler)</li>
<li>Be able to implement basic program control and data structures in an assembly language (loops, conditionals, subroutines and parameter passing modes, arrays)</li>
</div>

## What was new this semester
- Many tweaks and updates to the [github repo](https://github.com/aaronbloomfield/pdr)
- A (somewhat) reasonable amount of TA resources
  - But still less than we would like it to be
- The largest enrollment ever (300 students)
- Streamlined grading, even if we did run into hitches and delays
- Two instructors meant synchronizing the lectures more carefully

## What didn't work well
- Some minor submission server issues
- Occassionaly falling behind in the grading, although we generally kept up
- Support request response slowness
- Still not as many TA resources as we would like due to lack of departmental $$$
- Not having as many readings available as I would have liked
- VirtualBox caused a lot of issues for some people

## What did work well
- Submission and gradebook scripts!  This saved a HUGE amount of TA time, and streamlined submission and grading
  - Especially the support ticket system
- An excellent group of undergraduate TAs
  - All were returning TAs, which was has never happened before
- None of the labs had any major issues!  W00t!
  - Labs 6 & 10 do not count as "major issues"
- Use of the [github repo](https://github.com/aaronbloomfield/pdr), and almost no use of Collab
- Behind-the-scenes stuff: TA management, organization, etc.
	</script></section>

	<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Did we push too hard?
- We got as many "things are going great" comments as "things are going terrible"
  - Although anonymous feedback was rather lonely this semester...
- Part of the issues were the hard labs
- This course is meant to be a lot of work: a gateway into the CS electives
- The goal is to make you work efficiently, not necessarily more
- In hindsight, considering how much you accomplished this semester, was it still too much work?

## Changes for next semester
- After 10 straight years (20 semesters!), Bloomfield will no longer be teaching CS 2150
  - Floryan will be taking over both sections
- More students than ever (approximately 330)
- Updates to the content in the [github repo](https://github.com/aaronbloomfield/pdr) (specifically what's listed in the [github repo issues](https://github.com/aaronbloomfield/pdr/issues))
- With the office hour queue data, we can better target where to staff extra TAs for the busiest office hours
- More book chapters; we only had a few this semester; I'd like to expand on the x86 one for next semester, and add a heap/Huffman chapter
- VirtualBox is showing it's age, and may be replaced
- Course content changes (next slide)
	</script></section>

	<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## CS 2150 moving forward
- We moved to 64-bit x86 assembly in the fall 2016 semester
  - This semester, CS 2110 focused more on lists and BSTs (only)
- Fall 2017 changes
  - The data structures covered will change
  - CS 2150 may spend less time on lists and BSTs (now covered in CS 2110), but cover all the remaining data structures
    - We will introduce some new ones: perhaps set data structures
