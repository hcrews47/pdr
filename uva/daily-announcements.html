## Pop Quiz!

I started [Lab 6](../../labs/lab06/index.html) (hashes), and I think:

1. It's easy!
2. It's hard, but doable
3. It's insane!  Where do you get off assigning this much work?
4. I'm not talking to you.  Ever.  Again.

## Potential snow day Tues / Wed
- The forecast for the snow tonight and tomorrow keeps changing...
- If there is a snow day tomorrow...
  - Some/all labs will be converted to "online office hours"
    - Which ones will depend on which lab(s) are canceled
    - We'll email out about this
  - This means that we will enable private messages within Piazza, and you will be able to request online help through the TAs
  - This must be used reasonably, though!
  - We do not anticipate changing the due dates for pre-lab 6 nor for in-lab 6
    - We would, however, give everybody the standard 24-hour lab extension in the event of a snow day
- If lecture is canceled on Wednesday...
  - We may post a make-up slide, depending on how far we get into IBCM (which is next week's lab)

## Midterm procedure
- This is the procedure for both midterms this semester
- It is taken during your normal lab section
- The first rule of 2150 midterm is that you don't speak about 2150 midterm
  - Translation: it is an honor violation to speak about it to somebody who has not taken it yet
- You have to fill out the [bubble footer](http://www.cs.virginia.edu/~asb/images/exam-footer.jpg) at the bottom of the first page of the exam
  - And put your name and UVa userid at the top of each page
  - And sign the honor pledge
- There is typically a review session, likely the evening of the Sunday prior
- We hope to have it graded later that week (Thursday evening is our grading party)
  - Its completion will generate the first (of four!) course-wide emails
- There will not be office hours the Wednesday, Thursday, or Friday of a midterm week
- Obviously, no lab is released at the end of the week prior to the midterm
  - But one will be released the week *of* a midterm for the following week
- Many questions will have a "word limit"...

## Solving Common First Week CS 2150 Course Issues
1. Unable to submit (or see Collab) due to not (yet) being enrolled
  - Once you are enrolled, submit a support request, and we will give you extensions for the first lab so that you are not penalized.  You can view the course materials online at http://aaronbloomfield.github.io/pdr; Collab will become visible once you are enrolled
2. You were unable to submit the in-lab (*or* to submit an extension) due to the Great Lab One Internet Outage (or due to not having an account)
  - Submit a support request, and we will handle that for you as well
3. Virtual Box prevented you from submitting the pre-lab on time
  - Submit a support request, and we will handle that for you as well
4. Virtual Box is not yet installed (or not working)
  - Come to office hours right away to get this solved; we will give you extensions on lab 1 for this, but not on lab 2
5. You don't have a Linux account in Olsson 001 due to a late registration
  - You will receive it early next week (Monday), in time for lab 2; also see #2

Basically, we are not going to be jerks due to problems with enrollment, Internet outages, or Virtual Box installations.  At least for lab 1; for lab 2, all bets are off.
